Useful template for a new Objective-C project in Xcode by ShadeApps - all the necessary utilities to rocket start üöÄ your next iOS project.

Written entirely on plain old Objective-C and extremely extensible.

## Requirements

**Xcode version 7.3.1 (7D1014)** with **iOS 9.2 SDK** required.
**CocoaPods 1.0** is also a must.

## Installation

Clone the repo and run ```$ pod intsall``` in the dedicated project folder.
You could also use the built-in **PodInstall.command** file if you're super lazy.

‚ö†Ô∏è In order to launch the project, you need either to remove Fabric & Crashlytics from the project, or go to Target, Build Settings, Run Script & Edit this - line - ```./Fabric.framework/run``` ‚ö†Ô∏è 

## Compatibility

Tested on iPhone and iPad with iOS 8.0 and up, 9.0 and up and iOS 10.0 Developer Beta 1 & 2. Project minimal deployment target is iOS 8.0.

This project uses ARC and is Bitcode compatiable.
